/*
- Demo Scope: 
    - Create a variable in the global scope and set it to a book's title. 
    - Create a function that takes title, price, author, and imageUrl as parameters. 
    - Create a variable in function scope and set it to an empty object. 
    - Assign the object the properties of title, price, and author with their values set to their corresponding parameters. Add a key of inventory and set it to 0, and a key of reviews set to an empty array. 
    - Create a conditional statement that checks whether the imageUrl has a value. If it has a value, give the object the property of imageUrl with its value set to the parameter. Else create a variable with the value of 'placeHolderImage.jpg' within block scope and give the object property of imageUrl set to the variable in block scope. (Note: we can give the parameter a default value here, but this section's purpose is to demo scope.)

    - Return book object 
    - Invoke the function with arguments and pass it to inventory.push so the return value is added to the inventory array.
    - Show the different levels of scope using console.logs or debuggers. Where do we have access to variables declared in global scope? Where do we have access to variables declared in function scope? Where do we have access to variables declared at the block level? What does local scope mean?

- Demo Callbacks
